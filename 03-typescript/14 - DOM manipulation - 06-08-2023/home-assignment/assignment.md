### Easy
- Create a class (whatever you'd like) to hold some data.
- Create an array that holds some instances of the class you created above.
- Dump the array into the HTML page using `innerHTML`.
- Use an external CSS file to format the page.

Notes
- `innerHTML` only accepts a single value. Use array methods to create a single HTML fragment (string) to populate it.
- The actual HTML elements used for `innerHTML` doesn't matter (use `<p>`, a `<ul>` `<li>` combo or anything else).

### Medium
- Add an image property to the class above pointing a local image file for each instance.
- Include the image in the HTML output.

### Advanced
- Repeat the medium assignment using `document.createElement()` 
- Don't use `innerHTML` at all.
