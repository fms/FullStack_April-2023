This is a practice of writing functions.
- Don't bother with user input
- Write the requested function
- Add a number of dummy calls to demonstrate the use of the function.
<hr>

1. Write a function to negate the number passed to it:
- 5 ==> -5
- -100  ==> 100
<hr>

2. Write a function that returns the larger of two numbers.
- 5, 9 ==> 9
- 10,8 ==> 10
<hr>

3. Convert a Fahrenheit temperature to a Celsius one.
- The formula is: C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9
<hr>

4. Write a function that accepts three arguments: two numbers and an operation (1-4): a, b , op
- If operation is 1, return the sum of both numbers (a + b)
- If operation is 2, return the difference of both numbers (a -b)
- If operation is 3, return the product of both numbers (a * b)
- If operation is 4, return the quotient of both numbers (a / b)
- Otherwise, report an error
