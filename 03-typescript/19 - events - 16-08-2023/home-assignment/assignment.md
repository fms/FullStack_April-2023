## Easy
### Simulate the :hover pseudo class.
- Use events, not `:hover` to solve this.
- Draw a box on the screen.
- When the mouse enters the box the color changes.
- When the mouse leaves the box the color changes back to the original value (use the special value `initial` for this).

### Add a key logger
- Using the `keydown` event, display the key pressed by the user.

## Medium
### Create an image gallery
- Set up an array of images (either local or remote).
- Add a button for cycling forward to the next image.
- Add a button for cycling backward to the previous image.

### Password validation
- Add two password input fields.
- Using the `input` event make sure the second password matches the first one.
- Display an error (on the page, don't use `alert()`) if the passwords don't match.

## Advanced
### Tabs
- Start with the HTML and CSS from https://codepen.io/Fikri-Code/pen/GRZgOWo
- Write the javascript needed to switch the displayed contents whenever a tab is clicked.
