1. Do you know the "99 Bottles of Beer on the wall" song?

   - Create a loop, counting back from 99 which prints:

     > 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.<br>
     > Take one down and pass it around, now there's 98 more bottles of beer on the wall!<br>

   - When you reach 1, print:
     > 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.<br>
     > Take one down and pass it around, there's no more bottles of beer on the wall!<br>
   - exit when there are no more bottles.

2. Get a number (n) from the user.

   - Calculate and print the total: 1+2+3+...+n.
   - Use a loop and not the formula for this arithmetic sequence.

3. Get a number (n) from the user.
   - Use nested loops and calculate the total of 1+2+...+n for the series of length 1 to n. (1 + 1+2 + 1+2+3 + ... + 1+2+...+n).
   - Use an outer loop from 1 to n (outer)
   - Use an inner loop for the 1+2+...outer (again, loop, not formula)
