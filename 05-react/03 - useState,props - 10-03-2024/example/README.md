One possible solution to the home assignment.

Three components:

## Easy

A `Hover` component. This is really a forced example, as the CSS hover pseudo class is a better (a lower overhead) solution.

## Moderate

A `Follower` component that demonstrates using `useEffect` for handling the component life cycle by adding and remove an event listener.

## Advanced

A `Counter` component that keeps track of two states. Also, it uses a single handler with parameters for both add and subtract operations.
